This project has code for a bot that adds slash commands to a server to automatically toggle
the messagebility of specified channels

YOU WILL NEED:
	Somewhere to host the code (NodeJS)
	A discord application
		Permissions: bot, applications.commands
	A bot on that application
		Permissions: Manage Roles
	
	To create a config.json file in the root with the following data:
	{
		"clientId": "Insert your application clientId",
		"guildId": "Insert the guildId this bot will be in",
		"token": "Insert your bots token here"
	}
	
AFTER THE BOT HAS JOINED:
	Make sure to go to Server Settings -> Integrations -> {YOURBOTNAME}
	to edit which roles can use slash commands and which channels can
	have slash commands used in them
	
HOW IT WORKS:
	There are four commands created by this bot:
		/addtoggle
			Adds a text channel to a list of channels to toggle
		/removetoggle
			Removes a text channel from the list of channels to toggle
		/listtogglechannels
			Lists the text channels in the list of channels to toggle
		/togglemessageable
			Toggles all channels in the list from 
			messageable -> not messageable or not messageable -> messageable
